# Piscine-Reloaded
First Project in 42


This is our first project in 42, The Piscine Reloaded is a best-of of the exercises I did during the Piscine C to
remind me all the basics of the C programming language. All the exercises has to be
done entierly to unlock the next project.

It's a very easy project, I join the subject on the repository.
